This application has been updated to use the cascaded biquad filters from sc_dsp_filters.

For ease of building, pre-calculated files have been committed which provide the expected
number of banks for the filters. To regenerate the coefficients (for example to change
the peaking filter frequencies), edit Makefile.coeffs and rebuild using this file:
# make -f Makefile.coeffs
before rebuilding the application:
# make all

If 16 filters are not configured (or the range is changed from -16 - +16), unexpected
things may happen.
