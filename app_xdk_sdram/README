README:

This application uses the external SDRAM module as a simple framebuffer to drive the XDK LCD.
It loads a single image stored in the Flash to the SDRAM before displaying it. This could be
extended to support multiple images and a dual frame buffer, however space on the XDK flash
is very limited (it's only 128kBytes). The code is approx 12k, mainly buffers, so a 96k data
partition can be created to hold the bitmap. It supports bitmaps with 24bit colour only.

The following xflash command can be used to store a suitable bitmap onto the xdk:
xflash --boot-partition-size 0x8000 bin/app_sdram_burst_example.xe --data my_image.bmp
